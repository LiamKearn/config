# About
This is an extension to use vimium when creating a new tab. You can also use this for a custom newtab page.

For example mine is a simple grey from gruvbox since I use dark mode.

# Install

1. Goto `chrome://extensions`.
1. Make sure developer mode is on in the top right.
1. Manage the vimium extension.
1. Toggle `Allow access to file URLs`.
1. Run the provided `./install` script.
1. Customise newtab however you'd like (keep in mind that you can have autofocus working as well :)
